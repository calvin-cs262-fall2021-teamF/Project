# ToothFlex - CS262 Team Project at Calvin University 
## Vision Statement
Do you feel a tingling sensation in your teeth when you eat your favorite ice cream or drink your favorite tea? Do you feel nervous to talk because you know your breath smells bad? Brushing can be boring at times and we’ve found a way to skip that mood. With Toothflex you’ll find brushing just as exciting as your favorite activities. Our application turns this old and boring chore into an exciting game. Rewards, personalized song playlists, fun videos, memes, jokes, etc., among other forms of entertainment, are all included in this tiny app. Not only does it track your toothbrush time but it also provides you with a guide on the dos and don’ts of oral care. 

Instead of a simple tracker that takes up your whole screen space, why not watch your favorite show or get down with your grooviest song playlist. Along with that, post a comment, race against your buddies on who brushes daily, and enjoy the community that cheers you on to simply brush your teeth.

Life’s too short to wait for ice cream to melt or worry about others smelling the stench of death. Enjoy a boosted confidence with Toothflex, without having to sell an arm and leg for that expensive tooth repair
