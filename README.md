# ToothFlex - CS262 Team Project at Calvin University 
## Vision Statement
Have you ever wondered how two minutes of just brushing your teeth, can seem like an eternity? Well, you're not alone. Watching the clock only makes the task unbearable and irritating. We know how important your time is, and that is why we are here to help you achieve that confident smile. Toothflex is more than a toothbrush tracker. It turns that old and dull chore into an engaging game. Rewards, personalized song playlists, fun videos, memes, jokes, etc., among other forms of entertainment, are all included in this tiny app. It also provides users with a guide on the dos and don'ts of oral care. 
We recognize that traditional timers are not nearly engaging enough to make tooth brushing enjoyable. So, instead of a boring tracker that takes up your whole screen space, we give you the option of entertainment. Simply watch your favorite show or get down with your grooviest song playlist and brush on till the timer goes off. Toothflex keeps track of the userâ€™s daily brush routine and provides a post feature where users, from around the world, can comment and rate things such as best toothpaste, brushes, mouthwash, etc. They can also upload pictures or take notes on what might be their brushing diary to further help them establish a healthy oral routine. Toothflex makes toothbrushing a fun habit and improves your confidence and smile.
