# ToothFlex
## Vision Statement
Have you ever wondered how a short two minutes could seem so long? Well, that’s what a lot of people think while brushing and it just makes them want to get it over without really doing it the right way. We know how important this is and that is why, we are here to help you achieve that confident white smile. Toothflex is a toothbrush tracker for those who want to maintain good oral hygiene. It turns the old and boring brush-your teeth technique into a game with levels and power-ups. It includes rewards, personalized song playlists, fun videos, memes, jokes, etc., among other forms of entertainment. It provides users with some basic knowledge about oral care, giving tips on its dos and donts. You might be thinking, how does this application beat the traditional timer? Well, before the user starts brushing, they get to choose from the above entertainment options and simply continue brushing till the timer goes off. In this way, it keeps track of the users’ daily brush routine and provides a post feature where users can give feedback, comment on, or rate about things such as best toothpastes, brushes, mouthwash, etc. They can also upload pictures or take notes on what might be their personal brushing diary to further help them establish a healthy oral routine. Toothflex makes toothbrushing a fun habit and improves your confidence and smile
